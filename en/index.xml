      <description>Motivation Immediately after installing Ubuntu, the display resolution was set to 1368x768. The screen was inconveniently small when working with multiple terminals open, and since I had connected to a display (JAPANNEXT JN-MD-IPS1562FHDR) that can display 1920x1080, I wanted to display it in that resolution. I tried to change the resolution, but got into a bit of trouble, so here is a summary of the process. Sources Ubu</description>

      <description>Motivation I took on the challenge of creating a GPU cluster using multiple workstations I have set up at home to study Kubernetes. It was a hurdle for me, as I was new to Kubernetes.
