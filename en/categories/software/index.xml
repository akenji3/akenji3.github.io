      <description>Motivation I have been interested in Distributed Training for about a year. I have been experimenting with a distributed learning framework called Horovod on multiple TITAN-V-capable machines. I finally got a distributed training sample working, so I am posting it here. &amp;lt;! &amp;ndash;more&amp;ndash;&amp;gt; Sources. The original manual - Horovod in Docker, the original manual. The command line description for running docker is outdated, but it is a valuable A valuable</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May of this year, I posted an article &lt;a href=&#34;https://akenji3.github.io/en/post/20230502_rootlessdocker_en/&#34;&gt;Building Rootless Docker&lt;/a&gt;, but for some reason I decided to uninstall rootless docker. The following is a summary of the uninstallation procedure.
I will post the details of the circumstances that led to the uninstallation of rootless docker later.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Over a month ago, I became interested in NVIDIA Modulus at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://nvidia.connpass.com/event/284942/&#34;&gt;How to Speed Up Simulation with AI Surrogate Models?&lt;/a&gt; seminar I attended, I became interested in NVIDIA Modulus, so I bought the book and started studying it.
As a prerequisite for future study of Modulus, I installed Modulus in my environment, so I summarized the installation process as &amp;ldquo;Introduction to PINNs&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to try out a large-scale language model (LLM) for Japanese, so I used rinna, which was released in May. To save installation time, I ran rinna under a docker container environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ran into some problems in doing so, which are summarized below.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been a year since Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Jammy Jellyfish was released, and I decided to switch from my previous 20.04 to 22.04, thinking that I would be able to get used to the various software and other features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I installed ubuntu 22.04 Japanese Remix on several workstations so that I can use Japanese easily. I have gotten a bit stuck trying to install ubuntu 22.04 on a NVIDIA GPU-equipped workstation, so here is the situation and how I responded.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;motivation&#34;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;https://akenji3.github.io/en/post/20230502_rootlessdocker_en/&#34;&gt;a previous post&lt;/a&gt; I summarized how to start a docker container in user mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When using multiple PCs (WorkStation, hereafter WS), it is necessary to consider how to realize a mechanism to share containers among multiple WS. In the case of singularity, we could store sif files on an NFS server and use them from other WS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case of docker, I decided to build a registry server, thinking that I could set up a private registry in my home network and operate it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;motivation&#34;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been using singularity containers instead of docker. the reason I have avoided using docker is that it requires root privileges to launch containers. I don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about it because I&amp;rsquo;m running it at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I forgot the reason why, but I found out that docker has a rootless mode that allows you to run docker in normal user mode, so I decided to give it a try this time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <link>https://akenji3.github.io/en/post/20230318_pytorch_speed-up_en/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;motivation&#34;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my home environment where I use NFS to store JupyterLab notebooks, I measured the performance when the NFS server is a RaspberryPi or HP Z240, and found that in the learning loop (state in which epochs are stacked), there is no significant difference whether the NB is stored on an NFS server or locally. I found that there was no significant difference between NBs stored on an NFS server or locally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I have challenged to speed up the learning process, and I summarize the progress/results here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-the-beginning&#34;&gt;In the beginning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the five articles from &lt;a href=&#34;https://akenji3.github.io/en/post/20221230_galaxy_cnn_en/&#34;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;https://akenji3.github.io/en/post/20230219_galaxy_vit_2_en/&#34;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; Galaxy shape(morphological) classification was performed using CNN (VGG16, ResNet) and ViT.
In this article, I would like to consider the dataset used for the galaxy morphological classification, as I would like to re-examine the dataset when analyzing errors in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I have been studying Deep Learning for a while and thought I would try it out in my field of interest. I like astronomy and am particularly interested in stellar evolution, the formation of elements, and galaxy formation and evolution. I tried to classify the shape of galaxies, which seemed to be relatively easy to do.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Introduction About a month ago, I wrote an article about building a GPU cluster using kubernetes in this article. At that time, the GPU pod was in Pending state and did not work. After that, I managed to get it to work thanks to the advice of a certain person, so I&amp;rsquo;ll summarize it here.
In my environment, there is a problem that the GPU pod does not start up until a certain node is started, and furthermore, I have not been able to specify GPUs in a node, specify nodes, and so on, which is what I assumed, so I decided to call it &amp;ldquo;the first step&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Motivation Immediately after installing Ubuntu, the display resolution was set to 1368x768. The screen was inconveniently small when working with multiple terminals open, and since I had connected to a display (JAPANNEXT JN-MD-IPS1562FHDR) that can display 1920x1080, I wanted to display it in that resolution. I tried to change the resolution, but got into a bit of trouble, so here is a summary of the process. Sources Ubu</description>

      <description>Motivation I took on the challenge of creating a GPU cluster using multiple workstations I have set up at home to study Kubernetes. It was a hurdle for me, as I was new to Kubernetes. This is because I had to learn from the documentation whether the operations were necessary only during installation or when building the cluster (during operation). As it stands, the GPU cluster is not operational! This</description>

      <description>Motivation I had been thinking of the place to compile and store some researches and trials I had done on my field of interest. I decided to use mark downs to describe them, because I&amp;rsquo;d like to be able to rerecence pages on the internet, display source files such as shell script, and even express formulas.
When I was thinking about it, GigHub comes to mind and I decided to store and publish it on GitHub Pages.</description>
